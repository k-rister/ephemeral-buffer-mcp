# Ephemeral Buffer MCP Server (`ephemeral-buffer`)

An ephemeral in-memory command output capture and hybrid search engine (BM25 + Semantic Embeddings) for AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Antigravity, Cursor, etc.).

---

## 🎯 The Problem This Solves

When coding agents run commands that generate large outputs (thousands of lines of build logs, test runs, stack traces, JSON dumps), agents face two failure modes:
1. **Context Pollution:** Ingesting megabytes of raw text blows out token limits and degrades model reasoning.
2. **Blind Bash Filtering:** Agents waste multiple turns running `head`, `tail`, `grep`, and `awk` trying to guess error patterns.

## 💡 The Solution

`ephemeral-buffer` provides a transient in-memory ring buffer with **Dual Hybrid Indexing** and **Content-Aware Structure Parsing**:
- **BM25 Lexical Search (SQLite FTS5):** For exact matches on error codes (`NullPointerException`, `ECONNREFUSED`, `exit 137`, HTTP `502`).
- **Dense Semantic Vector Search (FastEmbed ONNX):** For fuzzy conceptual queries (*"Where did the DB connection pool fail?"* or *"Why did authentication fail?"*).
- **Unified Diff Structural Mapping:** Automatically detects git diffs and PR diffs (`gh pr diff`, `git show`, `git diff`), parses modified files, additions/deletions, and generates a line-indexed file map in the summary.
- **Smart Signal Filtering:** Scans command/build/test logs for diagnostic keywords, suppresses false positives in diffs and source code, and accurately captures test runner failures, unhandled exceptions, and merge conflicts. Use `content_type='log'` when a plain-text capture should be signal-scanned.
- **Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF):** Blends lexical and semantic ranking for high precision retrieval.
- **Ring Buffer Eviction:** Holds only the last $N$ captures (default: 10), ensuring zero persistent storage buildup or memory leaks.

## 🚀 How to Use It

### 1. From the Terminal (CLI Pipe via `agy-cap`)
You can pipe command output directly into the running MCP server:

```bash
# Pipe any command output into the buffer
pytest -v 2>&1 | agy-cap --label "pytest run"

# Pipe git diffs directly
git diff HEAD~3 | agy-cap --label "feature diff" --type diff

# Or wrap command execution
agy-cap --label "backend build" -- cargo build --verbose
```

The optional `--type`/`-t` hint accepts `auto` (the default), `diff`, `log`, or
`text`. Use `diff` for unified patches when automatic detection is ambiguous;
otherwise `auto` classifies diffs, build/test logs, and plain text from the
content and label.

### 2. From the AI Agent via MCP Tools

The agent has access to the following tools:

| Tool | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `execute_and_capture(command, cwd, label, content_type='auto')` | Executes a shell command, captures all output into the buffer, and returns a compact diagnostic summary (exit code, diff file map, or error signals) to the agent context. |
| `capture_text(content, label, content_type='auto')` | Ingests text directly into the buffer. |
| `capture_file(file_path, label, content_type='auto')` | Ingests a log/output file from disk. |
| `search_capture(query, mode, top_k, context_lines)` | Hybrid/BM25/Semantic search over the captured output. Returns matching chunks with surrounding context lines and exact line numbers. |
| `get_capture_slice(start_line, end_line)` | Retrieves exact line ranges to inspect full stack traces, logs, or specific diff files. |
| `get_capture_summary(capture_id)` | Diagnostic overview (line counts, diff file maps, error signals, preview). |
| `list_captures()` | Lists active captures in the ring buffer. |
| `clear_captures(capture_id)` | Clears buffer. |

For diff captures, `get_capture_summary` reports the detected file map,
addition/deletion statistics, line ranges, and merge-conflict signals. Use
`get_capture_slice` with those ranges to retrieve the complete file context.

### 3. Capture Hygiene

Keep captures focused so search results remain useful and the agent receives
only the context it needs:

- Capture one command or related output stream at a time, using a descriptive
  label.
- Start with `get_capture_summary`, then use `search_capture` or
  `get_capture_slice` for targeted retrieval instead of repeatedly recapturing
  the same output.
- Use `clear_captures(capture_id)` when a capture is no longer needed; use
  `clear_captures("all")` between unrelated investigations.

The buffer is intentionally transient and bounded by the ring-buffer limit,
but explicit cleanup prevents recent investigations from obscuring the active
one before automatic eviction occurs.
